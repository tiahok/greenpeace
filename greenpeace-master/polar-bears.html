        <p>
            Polar bears are marine mammals who live on the sea ice of the <span>Arctic Ocean</span>. With their thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent fur, they are well equipped to withstand cold water and air.
        </p>
        <p>
            These <span>predators</span> spend more than half of their time hunting for food, but they might only catch one or two out of ten seals they hunt. Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals, and walruses. A polar bear needs a good amount of fat to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to ongoing and potential melting of sea ice, polar bears were classified as threatened species under the <span>Endangered Species Act, in 2008</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There has been an increase in the number of polar bears venturing into Northern communities. Researchers say that climate change is to blame. It has forced these animals out of their hunting usual sites out of desperation for food. As the ice melts, food gets scarce and animals need to adapt. They follow the smell of food into human communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The protection of polar bears’ habitat is an urgent issue, as well as the survival of the species. It is a vulnerable species and it needs our help. Head to <a href="https://www.graesrod.org/">graesrod.org</a> to start a campaign.
